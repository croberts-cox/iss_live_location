# International Space Station Tracker

## Overview

This project is a single page application that utilises the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/) to present the current location of the International Space Station over the world. This is presented in the form of latitude and longitudinal coordinates along with the time stamp for that position. It also utilises the [Leaflet javascript library](https://leafletjs.com/) and [OpenStreetMap API](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) to visually demonstrate the live location on a map.

The app has been created using React.js and does not currently have a backend (purely front end developed).

## Notes for improvement

- [] Update layout of the site
- [] Update background colour and design
- [] Introduce auto update feature of the location
- [] Update map to centre around the ISS location after each refresh
- [] Introduce a list of people current in space (with a total)
- [] Show the country and region that the ISS is currently passing over
- [] Make text scalable/responsive with viewport size
- [] Fix responsive issues with map container

## Libraries used:

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- autoprefixer
- gh-pages
- postcss

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
